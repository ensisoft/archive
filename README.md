basic-light
===========

This is an old test application that I wrote for an OpenGL ES1 driver project.

gate-protect
============

A simple calculator that can evaluate simple mathematical expression such as 5 + 5
or "five plus five". This was written for some job application. Didn't get the job, not even
an invitatation for an actual interview ;-)
