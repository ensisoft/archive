Some old (mostly useles) codes

basic-light
===========

This is an old OpenGL ES1 test application.

gate-protect
============

A simple calculator that can evaluate simple mathematical expression such as 5 + 5
or "five plus five". This was written for some job application. Didn't get the job, not even
an invitatation for an actual interview ;-)

mastermind
===========
Simple ncurses based implementation of Mastermind (board game).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

Was written for some job application. Didn't get this job either, not even an interview. I guess the problem was though
that my salary request was above what they were willing to pay (this was Singapore after all where the pay is normally shit in SW dev jobs).
